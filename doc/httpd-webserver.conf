## GridSite httpd-webserver.conf - Andrew McNab <Andrew.McNab@man.ac.uk>
##
## For GridSite documentation, see http://www.gridsite.org/
##
## Example configuration file for GridSite as a Web Server 
## (that is, primarily for interactive use with a browser.)
## Listening is on ports 80/777 (HTTP) and 443/488 (HTTPS).
##
## (777/488 is to allow firewalls to distinguish between Grid and
## Web HTTP(S) traffic. See http://www.gridsite.org/wiki/IP_Ports )
##
## This file should be renamed /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and Apache
## restarted to use Apache2/GridSite as a webserver. 
##
## You do not need to install the GridSite mod_ssl.so module if you
## do not wish to use Globus Proxies or VOMS attributes, but you must
## have the mod_gridsite.so in /usr/lib/httpd/modules 
##
## We're assuming you have (a) the host's hostcert.pem and hostkey.pem 
## in /etc/grid-security/ and (b) the Certification Authorities' you
## trust have their root certs in /etc/grid-security/certificates
##
## (You can get RPMs for many European and North American Grid CAs
## from https://datagrid.in2p3.fr/distribution/datagrid/security/ ) 
##
## If you want to use DN Lists in ACLs, they should be placed/downloaded
## in /etc/grid-security/dn-lists/ or /var/www/htdocs/dn-lists/ 
## (Lists in /etc/grid-security/dn-lists/ override lists elsewhere.)
##
## To start serving files, make a directory /var/www/htdocs owned by
## apache.apache, including the file .gacl containing:
##
## <gacl>
## <entry>
##   <any-user/>
##   <allow><read/><list/></allow>
## </entry>
## </gacl>
##
## To enable writing, add DN List, Person or VOMS entries to the GACL
## (see the GridSite GACL document for the syntax.) For example:
##
## <gacl>
## <entry>
##   <any-user/>
##   <allow><read/><list/></allow>
## </entry>
## <entry>
##   <person>
##   <dn>/C=UK/O=eScience/OU=Manchester/L=HEP/CN=Andrew McNab</dn>
##   </person>
##   <allow><write/></allow>
## </entry>
## </gacl>
##
## and add the following directive to the HTTPS <Directory> section:
##
## GridSiteMethods GET PUT DELETE
##
## If you wish to accept Globus GSI Proxies as well as full X.509 user
## certificates, set GridSiteGSIProxyLimit to the depth of proxy you
## wish to accept. 
##
## (As a _rough_ guide: 0=No Proxies; 1=Proxy on user's machine; 2=Proxy 
##  owned by running Globus job; 3=Proxy delegated by a Globus job.)
##
## With this done and Apache restarted, you can upload a file with:
##
## curl -v --cert ~/.globus/usercert.pem --key ~/.globus/userkey.pem    \
##  --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates --upload-file /tmp/tmp.txt \
##  https://INSERT.HOSTNAME.HERE/tmp.txt
##
## (or with  --cert /tmp/x509up_u`id -u` --key /tmp/x509up_u`id -u`  to use
##  a Globus GSI Proxy created with grid-proxy-init.)
