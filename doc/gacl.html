<h1 align=center>GridSite: Grid Access Control Language</h1>

<p> 
GACL is the authorization policy language used by 
<a href="http://www.gridsite.org/">GridSite</a> GACL allows
policies to be written in terms of common Grid credentials: X.509
identities, GSI proxies, VOMS attribute certificates and lists of X.509
identities.

<p>
GridSite both uses GACL policies and provides a GACL manipulation API for
C/C++ in the GridSite library.

<h2>Credentials</h2>

<p>
In GridSite 1.0.x, four credential types are supported:

<p>
&lt;person&gt;
&lt;dn&gt;/O=Grid/CN=Name&lt;/dn&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;

<p>
&lt;voms&gt;
&lt;fqan&gt;/vo.dom.ain/group&lt;/fqan&gt;
&lt;/voms&gt;

<p>
&lt;dn-list&gt;
&lt;url&gt;https://www.vo.dom.ain/dn-lists/group&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;/dn-list&gt;

<p>
&lt;dns&gt;
&lt;hostname&gt;host*.dom.ain&lt;/hostname&gt;
&lt;/dns&gt;

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>
Five permissions are supported: Admin, Write, List, Exec and Read. Admin is
permission to modify the authorization policy itself, but applications can
map the other permissions to local methods as appropriate to their
environment. For filesystems and fileservers, Write, List and Read have
their usual meanings: creating or modifying files or directories; browsing
directories; reading files. Exec is not used by GridSite itself, and
applications are free to give it a meaning within their own contexts.

<p>
In 1.0.x, only per-directory GACL files are supported, and the file is stored
in the directory in question, or in one of its parent directories. (GridSite
searches upwards until it finds one.)

<p>
In GACL files, the permissions are represented by single tags:
&lt;admin/&gt;, &lt;write/&gt;, &lt;list/&gt;, &lt;exec/&gt;, &lt;read/&gt;.
Permission
tags are contained within Allow or Deny blocks. For example: 
&lt;allow&gt;&lt;read/&gt;&lt;list/&gt;&lt;/allow&gt; or 
&lt;deny&gt;&lt;admin/&gt;&lt;/deny&gt;.

<h2>Entries</h2>

<p>
Entries associate credentials with permission statements. Entries consist of
one or more credential blocks, and either an Allow or a Deny block, or both. 
If multiple credentials are present in one entry, they must all be held by a
user to receive the association permissions. (So Entries provide logical AND
of credentials.)

<h2>Access Control Lists</h2>

<p>
ACLs consist of a list of one or more Entry blocks. When a user's credentials
are compared to the ACL, the permissions given to the user by Allow blocks
are recorded, along with those forbidden by Deny blocks. When all entries 
have been evaluated, any forbidden permissions are removed from those
granted. (So Deny always wins over Allow, even between different Entries,
but otherwise ACLs provide logical OR of credentials.)
