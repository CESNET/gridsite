<h1 align=center>GridSite 1.1.x Documentation</h1>

<p>
<a href="http://www.gridsite.org/">GridSite</a>
is a set of extensions to the Apache 2.0 webserver, which support 
Grid security based on X.509 certificates. Since GridSite applies access
control within Apache itself, via mod_gridsite, Grid authorization and
the associated verified credentials are available to all technologies
supported by Apache, including static file serving, SSI, CGI, PHP, JSP and 
mod_perl.

<p>    
The <a href="http://www.gridsite.org/wiki/">GridSite Wiki</a> includes
guides and cookbook examples about using GridSite, along with up to date
information about the APIs.
