BUILDING/INSTALLING GRIDSITE
============================

For more detailed instructions, see the Installation and Build 
pages in the GridSite Wiki http://www.gridsite.org/wiki/

GridSite is currently only supported on Linux, but should be
trivially portable to other Unix platforms where the GNU build
tools are available.

When building from source, two routes are available: building
with Make or with RPM.

BUILDING WITH MAKE
==================

make 
make install

will build all components and install them all under the default
locations of /usr/local/[lib|bin|include|sbin] The default prefix
/usr/local is set by the prefix variable in the top level Makefile

BUILDING WITH RPM
=================

For RedHat Linux and derivatives, building with RPM is recommended.
The command

make rpm

will build the gridsite and htcp binary RPMs in the directory
../RPMTMP/RPMS/i386 relative to the working directory. A SRPM is 
put into ../RPMTMP/SRPMS

Building with RPM uses the default prefix /usr, although the
resulting RPMs are relocatable to other hierarchies.
