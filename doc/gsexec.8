.SH NAME
gsexec \- Switch user before executing external programs

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
 
.PP
\fBgsexec\fR -\fBV\fR
 

.SH "SUMMARY"
 
.PP
gsexec is used by the Apache HTTP Server to switch to another user before 
executing CGI programs\&. In order to achieve this, it must run as root\&. 
Since the HTTP daemon normally doesn't run as root, the gsexec executable 
needs the setuid bit set and must be owned by root\&. It should never be 
writable for any other person than root\&.
 
.PP
gsexec is based on Apache's suexec.
For further information about the concepts and the security model of 
the original suexec 
please refer to the suexec documentation: 

(http://httpd\&.apache\&.org/docs-2\&.0/suexec\&.html)\&.
 

.SH "OPTIONS"
 
 
.TP
-V
If you are root, this option displays the compile options of gsexec\&. 
For security reasons all configuration options are changeable only at 
compile time\&.
